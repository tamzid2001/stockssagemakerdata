# Quantura Website Prompt

Design a premium, elegant marketing site for **Quantura**, an AI-driven equity
research platform for serious investors. The site must feel institutional yet
modern—clean grids, deep navy palette, sharp typography, and confident
copywriting.

## Goals
- Convert newsletter sign-ups.
- Explain the product clearly in 60 seconds.
- Position the Pro plan and a one-time forecast upsell.
- Build trust with professionalism and clarity.

## Must-have Sections
1. **Hero**: headline, value proposition, CTA buttons (free newsletter + Pro).
2. **Core Free Product (Top of Funnel)**: highlight the weekly 5–10 mispriced
   stocks, 1–2 bullet commentary, and a chart/metric per stock.
3. **Upsells**: include a one-time forecast ($199) that blends current price,
   options pricing, and implied probabilities from Yahoo Finance.
4. **Use Cases**: weekly portfolio review, pre-earnings prep, thesis validation.
5. **Pricing**: free newsletter + Pro subscription + one-time forecast.
6. **Login/Sign Up**: modal or section.
7. **Settings**: toggles for promotional emails and upsell alerts.
8. **Contact**: support email, sales CTA.
9. **Footer**: terms, privacy, support email.

## Copy Style
- Use AIDA marketing framework: Attention → Interest → Desire → Action.
- Keep text concise, confident, and data-driven.
- No hype. Use professional, hedge-fund-like tone.

## Visual Style
- Colors: deep navy, slate, electric blue accents.
- Fonts: Inter or similar modern sans-serif.
- Buttons: rounded, bold CTA.
- Cards: subtle borders, soft shadows.

## Output
Provide production-ready HTML, CSS, and JS for a single-page site with modals
and placeholder Stripe checkout buttons.
